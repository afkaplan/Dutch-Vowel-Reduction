# Dutch Vowel Reduction
Files for analysis of optional Dutch vowel reduction

Here you can find OTSoft files for my work on Dutch vowel reduction.  This includes two related but distinct research projects:

1. Kaplan (2023), LSA poster: this poster uses Nazarov's (2019) analysis and argues that NHG (under the right circumstances) but not MaxEnt accounts for the data.  The difference lies in how the frameworks deal with harmonic bounding.

2. Kaplan (2023), WCCFL poster: this poster uses an analysis simpler than Nazarov (2019) and argues that it provides evidence for trial cancellation over random selection in dealing with ties under NHG.
